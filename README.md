# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to retrieve and analyze real time weather data, using the OpenWeatherMap API, for a travel company in order to recommend ideal hotels based on client's weather preferences. Essentially, a client inputs their weather preferences and then our Pandas DataFrame generates a map based on these inputs containing cities from across the world using Google Maps and Google Places API calls. In addition to these figures, we then created a travel itinerary map figure that would show the route between four cities chose from the customer's possible travel destinations. This figure uses a Google Directions API call and shows a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the customer's itinerary.
